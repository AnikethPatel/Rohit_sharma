    <li><p>Indian cricket in the current times sees a team of consistent and dependable athletes. After the series of ups and downs, it can be safely inferred that stability is slowly being harnessed within the team of the sub-continent. Standing high and stable in the list is Rohit Sharma, a player who can be easily counted upon to deliver with substance.</p>
    </li>
    <li><p>Rohit was born in Nagpur, Maharashtra, India to a very low income family to Gurunath Sharma and his wife Purnima on 30th April 1987. His mother being from Vizag, Andhra Pradesh, Rohit speaks Telegu. He has a younger brother named Vishal.
</p></li>
<li><p>He was mainly brought up by his grandparents and uncles because of his father's meagre income as a warehouse caretaker. He lived at a distance from his parents and would only get to visit them in the weekends.</p></li>
<li><p>Coming from a humble working middle class family, Rohit had dreams bigger than his horizons. He used to travel a lot in order to reach the stadium for practice. He has shown some persistent and resistant characteristics. This makes all the more reason why he is the opening batsmen of the team, in a country where billions of people dream to become a cricketer.</p></li>
